# CivitAI Tools Documentation

This directory contains all documentation for the CivitAI Tools project, organized by phase and purpose.

## üìÇ Directory Structure

### **üìä pre-investigation/**
**4-day comprehensive API investigation results (2025-07-13 to 2025-07-17)**

Contains the complete findings from the initial investigation phase:
- **Core API Specifications**
  - `civitai_api_comprehensive_specification.md` - Complete API documentation
  - `civitai_api_full_spec.md` - Full API specification details
  - `civitai_official_vs_discovered_features.md` - Comparison of documented vs discovered features

- **Feature Investigations**
  - `civitai_category_system_investigation.md` - Discovery of 15 hidden categories
  - `civitai_model_types_final_complete.md` - Complete list of 13 model types
  - `civitai_sort_options_investigation.md` - All 10 sort options analysis
  - `civitai_period_filter_specification.md` - Period filtering capabilities

- **Specific Studies**
  - `illustrious_version_investigation_report.md` - Illustrious model deep dive
  - `api_image_findings.md` - Image API endpoint discoveries

**Key Finding**: API provides 60% more functionality than officially documented (85+ fields available)

### **üéØ future-planning/**
**Planning documents for the new implementation**

Contains requirements and planning documents:
- `requirements.md` - Original project requirements
- `plan.md` - Implementation planning
- `searchplan.md` - Search functionality planning
- `ranking-rules.md` - Model ranking system design
- `review.md` - Review and feedback notes
- `tasklist.md` - Task tracking

## üîç How to Use These Documents

### For Understanding API Capabilities:
1. Start with `pre-investigation/civitai_api_comprehensive_specification.md`
2. Review `pre-investigation/civitai_official_vs_discovered_features.md` for hidden features
3. Check specific investigations for detailed functionality

### For Implementation Planning:
1. Review `future-planning/requirements.md` for project goals
2. Use investigation results to inform design decisions
3. Ensure all discovered API features are utilized

## üìà Investigation Summary

- **Duration**: 4 days (July 13-17, 2025)
- **API Fields Discovered**: 85+ (vs ~30 documented)
- **Hidden Categories**: 15 categories found
- **Model Types**: 13 types confirmed
- **Sort Options**: 10 options available
- **Key Achievement**: Discovered 60% more functionality than officially documented

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Investigation Completeness**: The pre-investigation phase was thorough and comprehensive
2. **Implementation Gap**: First implementation attempt (1st-coding/) only utilized 35% of discovered features
3. **Lesson Learned**: Future implementations must fully leverage the investigation findings
