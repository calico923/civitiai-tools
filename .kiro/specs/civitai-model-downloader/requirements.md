## Introduction

CivitAI Model Downloaderは、CivitAI.comからAIモデルを効率的にダウンロードするためのマルチプラットフォーム対応ツールです。既存の調査ツールとは独立した機能として、ユーザーがモデルの詳細を確認してから選択的にダウンロードできる仕組みを提供します。数KBから3TBまでの幅広いサイズのモデルファイルに対応し、プレビュー機能により事前に絵柄を確認できることを重視します。

2. WHEN I search by tags THEN the system SHALL return models matching specified tags (anime, style, etc.)
3. WHEN I search by base model THEN the system SHALL filter results by Illustrious, Pony, SD1.5, etc.
4. WHEN I browse results THEN the system SHALL display model name, type, base model, and basic stats
5. WHEN I view search results THEN the system SHALL support pagination for large result sets

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview model details and sample images, so that I can evaluate the art style before downloading

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a model THEN the system SHALL display detailed information including description, stats, and tags
2. WHEN I view model details THEN the system SHALL show sample images generated with the model
3. WHEN I view sample images THEN the system SHALL display them in a readable size with metadata
4. WHEN I check model versions THEN the system SHALL show available versions with their specific details
5. WHEN I review model info THEN the system SHALL indicate file sizes and download requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to selectively download models with progress tracking, so that I can manage large file downloads efficiently

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initiate a download THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress with percentage and speed
2. WHEN a download is interrupted THEN the system SHALL support resume functionality
3. WHEN I download multiple models THEN the system SHALL queue downloads and process them sequentially

5. WHEN a download completes THEN the system SHALL verify file integrity and report success/failure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to organize downloaded models with metadata, so that I can manage my model collection effectively

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is downloaded THEN the system SHALL save associated metadata (tags, description, stats)
2. WHEN I organize models THEN the system SHALL create appropriate folder structures by type/base model
3. WHEN I save model info THEN the system SHALL include sample images alongside model files
4. WHEN I manage downloads THEN the system SHALL maintain a download history with timestamps
5. WHEN I view my collection THEN the system SHALL provide a way to browse downloaded models locally

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple command-line interface, so that I can efficiently operate the downloader without complex UI
