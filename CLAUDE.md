# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This repository is currently empty and ready for initial project setup.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, the development environment and tooling will be established as the project grows. Common setup tasks may include:

- Initialize project structure
- Set up package management (npm, yarn, pip, etc.)
- Configure build tools and linting
- Establish testing framework
- Set up version control workflows

## Architecture

The project architecture will be documented here as the codebase develops.

## Notes for Future Development

- This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the project structure and tooling are established
- Add specific build, test, and lint commands once they are configured
- Document the main architectural patterns and folder structure as they emerge
